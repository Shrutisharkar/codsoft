        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio! I am Shruti Manilal Sharkar, a dedicated and creative web developer with a
            passion for crafting meaningful and efficient solutions. My journey in the world of technology began with
            a keen interest in building applications that make a positive impact on people's lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hold a Diploma in Computer Engineering and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer
            Engineering. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and
            software development methodologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the realm of web development, I specialize in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            I enjoy turning design ideas into interactive and responsive user interfaces. On the back-end, I have
            experience with server-side scripting and database management.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have actively contributed to various projects, including a Women Safety Application developed for
            Android, a Resume Builder Web Application, and a landing page for PVG College. These projects showcase
            my ability to tackle diverse challenges and deliver high-quality solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I love attending tech meetups, participating in hackathons, and engaging in the tech
            community. My goal is to continue learning and growing as a developer, contributing to impactful projects,
            and making a positive mark in the ever-evolving world of technology.
